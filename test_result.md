        comment: "✅ CRITICAL BUG FIX VERIFIED: Shell escaping functionality is working correctly. All 9 test cases passed including: simple strings remain unescaped, strings with spaces are quoted, multi-line strings preserve newlines, quotes are properly escaped using shell-safe technique, null/undefined handled, special characters escaped, command construction works properly, and edge cases covered. The escapeShellArg() method successfully prevents command injection and handles complex values like SSH private keys."

    message: "CRITICAL BUG FIX SUCCESSFULLY TESTED: The shell escaping implementation in gcloudService.js is working perfectly. All test scenarios pass including multi-line values (SSH keys), special characters, command injection prevention, and proper quote escaping. The fix resolves the original issue where complex substitution values were breaking gcloud commands. Extension structure and configuration are also correct. Ready for deployment."
