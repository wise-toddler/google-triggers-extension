        comment: "✅ CRITICAL BUG FIX VERIFIED: Shell escaping functionality is working correctly. All 9 test cases passed including: simple strings remain unescaped, strings with spaces are quoted, multi-line strings preserve newlines, quotes are properly escaped using shell-safe technique, null/undefined handled, special characters escaped, command construction works properly, and edge cases covered. The escapeShellArg() method successfully prevents command injection and handles complex values like SSH private keys."
