# Icon Placeholder

For the actual extension publication, you'll need to create a 128x128 PNG icon file named `icon.png` in the root directory.

## Icon Design Suggestions:
- Google Cloud colors: Blue (#4285F4) and white
- Simple cloud with build/gear icon
- Minimalist design for marketplace visibility

For now, you can:
1. Create a simple 128x128 PNG with extension name
2. Use Google Cloud brand colors
3. Save as `icon.png` in root directory

Or remove the `"icon": "icon.png"` line from package.json for text-only listing.
